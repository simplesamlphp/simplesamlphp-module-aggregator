Aggregator
==========

This is a module for SimpleSAMLphp that aggregates a set of SAML entities into SAML 2.0 metadata documents.
The resulting metadata documents contain an EntitiesDescriptor element with the multiple entities configured
as sources inside. Multiple aggregates can be configured at the same time.
